-- DESCRIPTION:
--     This package provides tailorable entities for a particular
--     implementation.  Each entity may be modified to suit the needs
--     of the implementation.  Default values are provided to act as
--     a guide.
--
--     The entities in this package are those which are used exclusively
--     in tests for Annex C (Systems Programming).
--
-- APPLICABILITY CRITERIA:
--     This package is only required for implementations validating the
--     Systems Programming Annex.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--     29 Jan 96   SAIC    Initial version for ACVC 2.1.
--      5 Jul 12   RLB     Added Minimum_Atomic_Component_Size.

   -- The procedure Generate_Interrupt should generate the interrupt
   -- identified by Interrupt_To_Generate within the time interval
   -- specified by Wait_For_Interrupt.

   -- The default body assumes that an interrupt will be generated by some
   -- physical act during testing. While this approach is acceptable, the
   -- interrupt should ideally be generated by appropriate code in the
   -- procedure body.
   --
   -- Note that Generate_Interrupt may be called multiple times by a single
   -- test. The code used to implement this procedure should account for this
   -- possibility.
