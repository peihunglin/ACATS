-- Note: Compiling this test might fail (either immediately or when the
-- unit is added to the environment at the end of the compilation), or
-- automatic recompilation of BA14001K might fail, or even automatic
-- recompilation of BA14001J might fail (because two compilations for the
-- same unit are going on simultaneously).
-- This subtest only requires that SOME error be reported for this compilation.
-- Note that 10.1.4(5) is a Legality Rule, not a Post-Compilation Rule;
-- link-time detection of this error is too late.
